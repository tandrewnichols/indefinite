# indefinite

Prefix a noun with an indefinite article - a or an - based on whether it begins with a vowel.

## Installation

`npm install --save indefinite`

## Summary

It's not hard to check whether a noun begins with a vowel and decide whether to prefix with "a" or "an," but I got tired of doing it manually every time. So now there's this. Just pass in the word, and `indefinite` will return the word prefixed with either "a " or "an " depending on the first letter of the word. Additionally, as of version 2.0.0, `indefinite` will attempt to detect when an acronym is passed in and treat the response differently. E.g. it should be "a UFO" not "an UFO" because of how we pronounce a long U. This isn't a perfect science, so you might have false positives.

## Usage

```js
var a = require('indefinite');

console.log(a('apple')); // "an apple"
console.log(a('banana')); // "a banana"
console.log(a('UFO')); // 'a UFO'
```

Indefinite also accepts an options object as the second parameter. Currently, two options are supported: `capitalize`, for capitalizing the article, and `caseInsensitive` for ignoring the casing of the word passed in (i.e. bypassing the acronym checking). This is useful if, for some reason, you're yelling on the internet and want to make sure "UGLY GARDEN GNOME" doesn't become "a UGLY GARDEN GNOME."

```js
console.log(a('apple', { capitalize: true })); // 'An apple'
console.log(a('banana', { capitalize: true })); // 'A banana'
console.log(a('UGLY SWEATER', { caseInsensitve: true })); // 'an UGLY SWEATER'
```

### Browser

Just serve `dist/indefinite.min.js` however you serve javascript, then call `indefinite("noun")`. The `indefinite` function is added to window.
